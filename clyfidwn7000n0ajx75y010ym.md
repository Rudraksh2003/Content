### Example: Configuring a Jenkins Pipeline

Let's walk through an example of configuring a Jenkins pipeline using both Declarative and Scripted syntax.

#### Declarative Pipeline

The Declarative Pipeline provides a simplified, structured approach to defining your CI/CD pipeline. Hereâ€™s an example of a basic Declarative Pipeline that builds a Java project using Maven, runs tests, and deploys the application:

```plaintext
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'scp target/your-app.jar user@server:/path/to/deploy'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline succeeded!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

#### Scripted Pipeline

The Scripted Pipeline offers greater flexibility and control, allowing you to use Groovy syntax to define your pipeline. Hereâ€™s the same pipeline as above, but using Scripted Pipeline syntax:

```plaintext
node {
    try {
        stage('Checkout') {
            checkout scm
        }

        stage('Build') {
            sh 'mvn clean install'
        }

        stage('Test') {
            sh 'mvn test'
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            sh 'scp target/your-app.jar user@server:/path/to/deploy'
        }

        echo 'Pipeline succeeded!'
    } catch (Exception e) {
        echo 'Pipeline failed!'
        throw e
    }
}
```
